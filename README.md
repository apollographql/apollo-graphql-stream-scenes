# Apollo GraphQL Stream Scenes

> This repository hosts the server and web app used to power layouts for livestreaming.

## Architecture

It ain't much, but it's honest work. 👨‍🌾

### Client
The client is a React app created with `create-react-app`.

- `scenes`: full layouts to be used as scenes in OBS. Including alerts and chat (powered by the server).

- `overlays`: meant to be imported as individual browser sources for things like chat, new followers, etc.

- `components`: base components
